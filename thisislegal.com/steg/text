 cross-Site scripting (xss) vulnerabilities are very often misunderstood and not given the due concern and Attention they deserve by vendors. xss is the preferred acronym for cross-site scripting simply to Minimize the confusion with cascading style sheets (css). simply put, a web application vulnerable to xss allows a user to inadvertently send malicious data to him or herself through that application. attackers often perform xss exploitation By crafting malicious urls and tricking users into clicking on them. these links cause client side scripting languages (vbscript, javascript, etc.) of the Attacker s choice to execute on the victim s browser. xss vulnerabilities are caused by a failure in the web application to properly validate user input.
